## CUDA Accelerated Data Augmentation for ECG Signals
This repository provides a CUDA-accelerated solution for data augmentation of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, leveraging GPU processing to significantly speed up augmentation tasks. The augmentation techniques implemented here are essential for enhancing model performance and generalization in ECG classification and analysis tasks by artificially expanding the dataset.

The augmentation techniques include noise addition, frequency shifting, amplitude scaling, time warping, and random cropping. Each augmentation method is designed to mimic real-world variations in ECG signals, helping models become more robust to different types of input.
